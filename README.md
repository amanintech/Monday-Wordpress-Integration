## Background 

Twimbit is a technology company giving market research. We use WordPress as a content publishing platform. But how can we manage our publications and collaborate? Monday.com was the answer. So, we set-up Monday boards with automated workflows for our use case. Life was meant to be a simple handshake between content publishing and content management. 

### The Problem  
Till we discovered the inefficiencies in the system. A lot of back and forth between Monday and WordPress in which users had to manually update things. 

### The opportunity 
Integrate with Monday API V2. As we built it on top of WordPress, we realized that we could extract the core and make it an open service for anyone using WordPress.


## Introduction
This integration lets users synchronize there WordPress site with Monday to create efficient workflows and automation. Monday users can synchronize posts, pages, users, comments, and taxonomies from WordPress to Monday and vice versa. This opens a new window of automation opportunity for publishers, content creators, or simply anyone using WordPress to create custom workflows and connect various other platforms without any additional plugin installation on WordPress.

## Benefits

b. Assign Tags and categories using tags fields.
c. Load Comments as updates to the posts.
d. Synchronize post status and Monday status
e. Add the preview post link.
2.  When a WordPress Page is created, create a new item and sync future changes.

3. When a new Monday item is created, Create a Draft post in WordPress.

4. When an item status changes to something, change WordPress post status to something

5. When a new WordPress user is added, create a new item on Monday

6. When a new Comment is added create a new item.

>  ......  Many more integrations coming soon.


## How does it works?
The integration uses Monday V2 API with Authorization, custom triggers and actions, and WordPress Rest API. Since WordPress users can have any site, so to have a standard backend app, we have created a middleware application between Monday and WordPress that runs all the transaction on Standard URL‚Äôs.

### Getting Started

Users will also need to install an additional WordPress plugin on their WordPress website and enter asked details during integration.
